Welcome to the metric converter! This metric converter can only currently run the following 4 conversions: cm to in, cm to mm, ft to yd, and m to ft.
Note that cm = centimeters, in = inches, mm = milimeters, ft = feet, yd = yards, and m = meters.

The program will first ask you to choose between one of these four conversions, listing the number listed in front of the conversion you want to do.
For cm to in, you will enter "1" (without the quotation marks) into the terminal.

Next, you will be asked to input a number. This number belongs to the first number of the conversion method you chose.
If you chose cm to in, entering "20" (without the quotation marks) means 20 cm will be converted to its in equivilant amount.

After this number is entered, the computer will then tell that number of the first unit is equal to how many of the second unit.
For example, if you entered "1" for the cm to in conversion when you first started the program and then entered "20" after being prompted for a number,
the computer would say "20 cm is equal to 7.87 in."

Note that the metric converter rounds off large decimals, although still keeps them large.
This is for the purpose of accuracy (rounding is always a close estinare) while also not having numbers that are too large.

After this, the computer will, once again, prompt you to choose a conversion, restarting the process all over again.

If you wish to exit the program, enter "-1" (without the quotation marks) into the program at any time. This will immediately stop the program.

If you enter any invalid inputs into the terminal, the program will prompt you, either saying to enter a postive number or that your input is incorrect.
This is due to the fact that the program only does 4 conversions, so it only uses "1", "2", "3", and "4" (without quotation marks) for you to use to select a prompt.
This also due to the fact that entering a negative number when prompted to enter a number for your first unit will result in a negative result.
Not only that, but you are entering a negative number of units. Units are typically non-negative, so it does not make sense for negative conversions to be allowed.
